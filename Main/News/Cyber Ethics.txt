The concept of cyber ethics gradually evolved as a response to these emerging challenges.

2.2 Milestones in Cyber Ethics

Over the years, several milestones have shaped the field of cyber ethics:

2.2.1 The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (1992): The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) established a code of ethics for computing professionals. This code emphasizes principles such as honesty, confidentiality, and respect for the privacy of others.

2.2.2 The Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace (1996): John Perry Barlow, a co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, penned a declaration asserting the independence of cyberspace from the governance of traditional nation-states. It called for a new set of ethical principles that would govern online interactions.

2.2.3 The Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) (1998): COPPA was enacted in the United States to protect the online privacy of children. It imposed requirements on websites and online services that collect information from children under the age of 13.

These milestones reflect the growing recognition of the need for ethical standards in cyberspace and the ongoing effort to establish a framework for responsible behavior online.

3. Online Privacy and Data Ethics

3.1 Data Collection and Surveillance

One of the most pressing ethical issues in the digital age is the collection and surveillance of personal data. With the proliferation of online services and the internet of things (IoT), individuals' personal information is constantly being collected and analyzed. Tech giants and other organizations often engage in extensive data mining to profile users and target them with personalized advertisements. This raises concerns about consent, transparency, and the potential for abuse.

3.2 Consent and Informed Decision-Making

5.2 Net Neutrality

Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all data on the internet the same way, without discriminating or charging differently by user, content, website, or application. The ethical question here is whether ISPs should have the power to control access to information and online services.

5.3 Intellectual Property in the Digital Age

The digital age has created challenges for intellectual property rights. Ethical issues arise regarding digital piracy, copyright infringement, and the fair use of digital content. Striking a balance between protecting creators' rights and ensuring access to knowledge is a persistent ethical challenge.

5.4 The Right to be Forgotten

The right to be forgotten is a concept that allows individuals to request the removal of personal information from search engine results and websites. This raises ethical questions about the tension between an individual's right to privacy and the public's right to access information.
